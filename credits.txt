    Made great contributions to GMod over the years with different contents/addons.
    I used parts of Half Life Renaissance weapon's code to re-create specific HL1 weapons.
    Not seeking explicit permission for custom re-write as steam profile stats:

        "Don't add me about anything gmod-related or related to my workshop addons."

        and content says:

        "I'm done with gmod and I don't take requests, so please stop spamming the comment section.
        There won't be any updates or new packs."

    And Code was non-functional as it existed.
