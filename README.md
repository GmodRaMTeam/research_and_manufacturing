 - Dynamic HTML Interface (Done through RiotJS/Semantic-UI)
 - Configurable/Customisable to those with some rough LUA/HTML/JS knowledge

#### Silverlan: https://steamcommunity.com/id/silverlan
    Made great contributions to Gmod over the years with different contents/addons.
    I used parts of Half Life Renaissance weapon's code to re-create specific HL1 weapons.
    Not seeking explicit permission for custom use as steam profile stats:

        "Don't add me about anything gmod-related or related to my workshop addons."

        and content says:

        "I'm done with gmod and I don't take requests, so please stop spamming the comment section.
        There won't be any updates or new packs."

    And Code was non-functional as it existed.
#### Valve/Possible 3rd Party Modeler
    For:
        - HL1 Gluon Gun model (weapon_egon)
        - HL1 Gauss Gun model (weapon_gauss)
        - Associated viewmodels/worldmodels/textures/materials
    The associated assets are not my content, and were distributed with the code for said weapons. I'm assuming the author had   
    permission to use them or they are re-makes. If this is not the case I will gladly remove these assets and require HL:S for this 
    content
